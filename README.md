PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS-TEXT EDITOR

# My Task

MY task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. 
Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. 
The application will also function offline.

# Acceptance criteria

WhenI run `npm run start` from the root directory then  I see that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
and my files have been bundled using webpack
When I open the text editor I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
When I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window then I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WhenN I reopen the text editor after closing it then I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
When I click on the Install button then I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
When I load my web application then I should have a registered service worker using workbox
When I register a service worker then I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
The application is also deployed to Heroku
